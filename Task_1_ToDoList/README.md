Task 1 included creating a To-Do-List application using Python Programming language.<br>
Created a Command-Line, as well as a GUI based application (using tkinter), allowing users to create, update & track their to-do list.<br><br>
Explanation of the GUI Code<br><br>
1)TodoApp Class: This class defines the structure and functionality of the To-Do List application.
init: Initializes the main components of the GUI (listbox, entry field, buttons).<br>
2)add_todo: Adds an item to the to-do list.<br>
3)remove_todo: Removes the selected item from the to-do list.<br>
4)clear_todo: Clears all items from the to-do list.<br>
5)main Function: Creates the main application window and starts the Tkinter event loop.<br><br>
This GUI-based To-Do List application allows users to add, remove, and clear to-do items. It provides a more interactive and visually appealing way to manage tasks compared to the command-line version. <br>
